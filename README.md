"Simplest Theme" is an elegantly crafted Visual Studio Code theme that combines purposeful colors with the versatility of Tailwind CSS's shades of gray. This minimalist theme offers a clean and focused coding environment while providing a range of ten color themes to suit your preferences.

At the core of "Simplest Theme" are four distinctive colors that serve as highlights:

1. Main Foreground Color: The main foreground color, either white for dark mode or black for light mode, represents variables. Its high contrast against the background ensures excellent readability and allows for easy identification of variable declarations.
2. Blue Color: The blue color is dedicated to elements related to the language that are not editable. It offers a consistent visual distinction for keywords, language-specific constructs, and predefined symbols, helping them stand out while maintaining the overall simplicity of the theme.
3. Purple Color: Reserved for elements that can be modified, such as functions, classes, and types, the purple color allows for quick identification and differentiation of user-controlled code segments. It provides a visually pleasing contrast against the background, making your code more accessible and modifiable.
4. Green Color: The green color signifies hardcoded elements like strings and numbers. Its vibrant hue allows for easy identification and differentiation of these literal values, simplifying modification and improving code comprehension.

To further enhance the theme's versatility, "Simplest Theme" includes Tailwind-inspired shades of gray:

- Slate (Dark and Light variations)
- Gray (Dark and Light variations)
- Zinc (Dark and Light variations)
- Neutral (Dark and Light variations)
- Stone (Dark and Light variations)
